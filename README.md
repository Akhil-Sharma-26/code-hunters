## Objective
Our idea is to create a website which can assist a college student, not only by providing notes and academic related content but also other things  like financial info. about the available student loans from different banks and the scholarship available, and also keeping them updated with the all the events going in the campus and outside of it, so they never miss an opportunity, then we also aim at providing them with a section where they can prepare for internships, and also apply for them, so basically providing a one stop solution to all there needs.
## Stack Used
We used MERN to implement this website, frontend is fully based on React supported with SCSS for stylesheets, backend in this application is minimal which holds the details of users with their hashed passwords (using Bcrypt).
